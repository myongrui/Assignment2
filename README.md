# Covid-19 Hub

Agenda
----------------------- 
Our project will be based on Covid-19. It consists of real time and accurate information on the Covid-19 situation internationally. It allows the user to be aware of the Covid-19 situation in the different parts of the world. This project will also allow the users to read up on news and articles about Covid-19 from reliable sources. Alongside that, they will be able to learn how they can prevent themselves from catching the virus. This simple but fun and engaging website is targeted to spread more awareness about Covid-19 situation in the world and dispell some of the rumours it has. It shows collated data on the Covid-19 situation globally and for each continent and country. It aims to target an audience of all ages as it will be suitable for all ages to visit.

Design Process
--------------
-   As a user that first visits the website, I would want to see a website that has a pleasant colour combination to look at and nice fonts
-   As a user, I would want a website such as this genre to be informative but not too wordy and boring
-   As a user, I would also want the website to be neatly organised throughout so that I would not be lost while navigating through the website
-   As a user, I would want to be able to see that the news are reliable sources so that I would not be fed with false information
-   As a user that has a short attention span I want the website to be slightly interactive to make it more fun for the younger audience and make the website look less boring in general
-   As a user, I would also want some implementation of a quiz/game to add some challenge in the website so that I would stay longer on it
-   As a user that enjoyed my experience on this website, I would want to know who made the website and be able to contact them and give them credits
