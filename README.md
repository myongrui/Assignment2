Project Name and Agenda
----------------------- 
Our project will be based on Covid-19. It will consist of real time and accurate information on the Covid-19 situation both locally and internationally. It allows the user to be aware of the Covid-19 situation in the different parts of town in Singapore. This project will also allow the users to read up on news and articles about Covid-19 and some facts in which they can prevent themselves from catching the virus. This simple but fun and engaging website is targeted to spread more awareness about Covid-19 situation in the world and dispell some of the rumours it has.
